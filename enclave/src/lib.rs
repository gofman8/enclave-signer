// Release guards (dev-mode). Three dev-only
// features are catastrophic if accidentally enabled in a shipped build:
//
//   * `allow-seed-import` - the parent can install a chosen seed on a fresh
//     enclave, defeating the in-enclave key custody.
//   * `mock-attestation`  - zero-PCR attestation documents are accepted, so
//     a forged "enclave" passes verification.
//   * `dev-mode`          - every signing cross-check is skipped.
//
// A release build (`debug_assertions` off) must never carry any of them, so
// each trips a `compile_error!`. `not(test)` exempts `cargo test --release`,
// which legitimately exercises the dev paths; local dev images build in debug.
//
// `dev_feature_release_guard!` keeps the three checks in one place.
