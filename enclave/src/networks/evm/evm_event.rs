//! Independent in-enclave verification of the EVM `FundsIn` deposit event for
//! bridge-mode `signPsbt`.
//!
//! Bridge-mode `signPsbt` releases RGB against an EVM deposit. Instead of
//! trusting the listener's `evm_event_valid` / `evm_event_finalized` booleans,
//! the enclave fetches the deposit's transaction receipt over an in-enclave EVM
//! RPC and checks itself that a `BridgeFundsIn` log was emitted by the pinned
//! bridge contract, with the claimed amount, at sufficient confirmation depth.
//! Every predicate is fail-closed.
//!
//! Trust boundary: the RPC is reached through the loopback -> vsock forwarder,
//! so responses are relayed by the untrusted host. A withheld receipt fails
//! closed; a forged one is only ruled out once Helios verifies the RPC
//! inside the TEE.
//!
//! Divergence: rather than matching the listener-forwarded raw log,
//! this module pins the contract from config and independently decodes and
//! binds the semantic fields (`operationId`, gross/net/commission). So
//! `evm_log_index` / `evm_event_topics` / `evm_event_data` are unused by
//! design.
//!
//! Not bound here: `operationId` has no on-chain link to the RGB mint being
//! signed, so that association stays listener-supplied. Amounts are
//! compared as `u64` because the proto carries them that way; an on-chain value
//! exceeding `u64` is rejected fail-closed (see [`extract_uint256_as_u64`]).
//!
//! `operationId` is a contract-derived `bytes32`, and the binding is required:
//! exactly 32 bytes matching the on-chain topic, or refuse.
