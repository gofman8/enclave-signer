///   1. The consignment's last transition is the type this flow signs.
///   2. Identity bind: `psbt.unsigned_tx.compute_txid()` equals the
///      consignment's last witness txid, and every input spends a native
///      witness program. A native witness program finalizes with an empty
///      `scriptSig` (BIP-141), so the unsigned txid is the final txid and
///      signing this PSBT finalizes the validated transition. An input that
///      finalizes with a `scriptSig` (P2SH-wrapped SegWit, legacy) moves the
///      txid off the one the consignment names, so it is refused here.
///   3. Per-input canary: when the consignment embeds the full witness tx, the
///      PSBT input outpoints must equal its prevout set. Redundant given (2);
///      a mismatch means a broken consignment invariant.
///   4. Sighash guard: only ALL / taproot-DEFAULT, so a host cannot splice our
///      signature into a different tx.
///   5. Whole-bundle scope: both amount binds run over every transition the
///      signed txid commits, not just the last one. The group must be
///      non-empty, must contain that last transition, and every member must be
///      the type this flow signs (which also rules out a mixed bundle).
///   6. Aggregate amount bind: the group's summed `asset_output_amount`
///      (`OS_ASSET` allocations only, excluding the `OS_BRIDGE` mint right)
///      against `source_amount - source_commission`, under the active flow's
///      rule - exact equality for a mint, a coverage lower bound for a
///      transfer (whose total includes bridge change).
///   7. Per-output recipient bind: each `OS_ASSET` output is
///      classified by its seal. A confidential (`utxob:`) seal is a recipient
///      leg; a revealed (`txid:vout`) seal counts as bridge change only if the
///      outpoint it names is provably ours (`self_owned`). Anything else is
///      rejected. The recipient total must equal `net_credited` exactly.
///
///      The outpoint need not sit on the tx being signed: with no BTC change,
///      rgb-lib parks the RGB change on an existing wallet UTXO. Same proof,
///      plus an indexer round-trip, capped at
///      [`MAX_OFF_TX_CHANGE_OUTPOINTS`] per PSBT.
///
/// `self_owned` resolves whether a Bitcoin outpoint pays back to this enclave. It is
/// a callback rather than a `&KeyManager` so the caller holds the key lock only
/// for that resolution, never across consignment validation's network calls.
///
/// Returns the [`AssetLegs`] this walk classified: the recipient leg in asset
